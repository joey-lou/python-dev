# Python Dev Poractice
Development practice projects in Python\
Referencing Udemy course *100 days of Code* by Angela with some tweaks

## Navigate through repo
The repo is very loosely structured, but the idea is to be able to easily setup and run the scripts locally. The package content is not meant to be ran in production.
